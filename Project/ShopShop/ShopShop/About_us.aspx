                        ShopShop has always represented a sense of adventure,<br /> achievement and dedication.
                        The history of the name dates<br /> back to the 1920's. Compagnie Generale ShopShop, a<br /> pioneer airmail company,
         was the first company to fly<br /> between South America and France… most definitely a<br /> spectacular achievement for its day.
